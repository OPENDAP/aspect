This describes changes to the TOMOFILT ESEP package OPeNDAP got from
Sarah Stamps in early 2020. The original documentation is in the
readme_ESEP_new document. The authors of the software are:

Paula Koelemeijer
pjkoelemeijer@cantab.net

Jeroen Ritsema
jritsema@umich.edu

Changes to teh TOMOFILT ESEP software were made by OPeNDAP (Kodi Neumiller
<kneumiller@opendap.org> and James Gallagher <jgallagher@opednap.org>) so
that only the code used for pre-processing data in netCDF files and served
by OPeNDAP servers was built. We also added 'clean' targets to make it
easier to see which files were built by the code and which are static inputs
or examples.

To run the programs here, you will need data files for the 'utils' directory.
Get those from http://www.opendap.org/pub/BALTO/tomofilt_new_ESEP_utils.tar.bz2.
Download the tar file and expand that here. It will make the 'utils' directory
and put the data files inside it. Some of the data files are too large to
push to GitHub, hence the tar file.

The top-level Makefile can be used to build and clean the software.

Use 'make all' to build the code, 'make clean' to remove generated data,
'make libclean' to remove the static libraries and 'make reallyclean'
to remove the built binaries.
